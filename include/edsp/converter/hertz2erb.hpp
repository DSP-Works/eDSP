     * @brief Converts a frequency in Hz into an equivalent rectangular band rate (ERB).
     *
     * The erb scale is measured using the notched-noise method [3].
     *
     * We have \f$ df/de = 6.23*f^2 + 93.39*f + 28.52 \f$ where the above expression gives the Equivalent Rectangular
     * Bandwidth (ERB) in Hz  of a human auditory filter with a centre frequency of f kHz.
     *
     * By integrating the reciprocal of the above expression, we get:
     * \f[
     *     e = a \ln \frac{f/p-1}{f/q-1}
     * \f]
     * where p and q are the roots of the equation: -0.312 and -14.7 and
     * \f[
     *     a = \frac{1000}{(6.23*(p-q)} = 11.17268
     * \f]
     * We actually implement e as
     * \f[
     *    e = a \ln (h - \frac{k}{f+c})
     * \f]
     * where \f$ k = 1000(q - q^2/p) = 676170.42 \f$
     * \f[
     *     h = \frac{q}{p} = 47.065
     * \f]
     * \f[
     *     c = -1000q = 14678.49
     * \f]
     * and f is in Hz
     *
     * @param f Hz Frequency in Hz.
     * @returns The equivalent rectangular band rate in Hertzz.
     * @see hertz2erb
     * @see [1] B.C.J.Moore & B.R.Glasberg "Suggested formula for
     *          calculating auditory-filter bandwidth and excitation
