    /**
     * @brief Converts an equivalent rectangular band rate (ERB) into Hz.
     *
     * The erb scale is measured using the notched-noise method [3].
     *
     * We have \f$ df/de = 6.23*f^2 + 93.39*f + 28.52 \f$ where the above expression gives the Equivalent Rectangular
     * Bandwidth (ERB) in Hz  of a human auditory filter with a centre frequency of f kHz.
     *
     * By integrating the reciprocal of the above expression, we get:
     * \f[
     *     e = k \frac{\ln\frac{f/p-1}{f/q-1}}{d}
     * \f]
     * where p and q are the roots of the equation: -0.312 and -14.7 and
     * \f[
     *     d = \frac{(6.23*(p-q)}{1000} = 0.08950404
     * \f]
     * from this we can derive:
     * \f[
     *  f = k/(h-exp(d*e)) + c
     * \f]
     * where \f$ k = 1000(q - q^2/p) = 676170.42 \f$
     * \f[
     *     h = \frac{q}{p} = 47.065
     * \f]
     * \f[
     *     c = 1000q = -14678.49
     * \f]
     * and f is in Hz
     *
     * @note Note that erb values will be clipped to 43.032 which corresponds to infinite frequency.
     * @param erb The equivalent rectangular band rate in Hertz.
     * @returns Hz Frequency in Hz.
